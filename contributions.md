Part of my works are listed over here.  Some of the contents listed underneath, I fondly call them - *labs*. :smile:

# Page Summary

These sessions extend beyond than just getting one familiar to programming languages.  I'd also be hosting stuff related to electronics, communications systems, virtual prototyping, build system generators, CI/CD integration, etcetera.

Few of these are specially created lab-sessions.  The sessions listed over here are basically aimed at getting started with the under-listed topic of interest faster.
