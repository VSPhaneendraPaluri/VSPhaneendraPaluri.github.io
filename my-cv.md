## <u>Career Summary</u>
I'm a C++ developer with keen interest towards working with different CPU architectures and the associated ecosystems. My current and past varied experiences have enabled me learn about the various facets of the semiconductor industry.

My specialities range from experience in 
  - Custom processor (fast models) development
  - SoC functional modelling of sub-systems, peripherals
  - Architectural exploration of cache systems, imaging sub-systems, bus protocols
  - Contributor to the Accellera-CCI (IEEE) Working Group
  - Developing CXX tools targeting Instruction Stream Generators (ISGs) for chip verification activities
  - Protocol modelling using Synthesizable subset of SystemC (knowhow on Forte's Cynthesizer tooling)
  - Modelling using SystemC-AMS

Before to joining semiconductor industry, I've worked for the defence and commercial robotics industry where-in my primary works were related to Embedded and Control Systems, Robotics & AI. 

I've also participated in various forums - ISCUG, DVCON, NASCUG and presented my works over there. I've prepared information on tools required for the Press Releases.

During my free time, I explore various technologies and upcoming trends. Am an active blogger and more about my works, contributions, learnings, interests, one may find it here - <i>https://vsphaneendrapaluri.github.io/</i> (you are reading this!)
