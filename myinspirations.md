I'm an *avid follower* of the latest *electronics and communication* developments happening in and around us.

My facination towards electronics started when I happened to visit an Air Force Base Station and saw some dots blinking on the compass.  I was then told by my father, who himself served as a radar technician, that those dots are nothing but aeroplanes.

Over a period of time, these interests pumped up good amount of adrenaline in me and motivated me to choose *Electronics & Communcations* as my subject of study.  This domain interested me so much that I really started to develop a liking for the Physics, appreciated the way (atomic) Physics enabled development of semiconductor Integrated Circuits (ICs).

It first started off with programming small circuit boards, then went onto learning how to flash some generated bit streams onto FPGAs.  That was my first hit at Simulations.

Electronics lays the basic foundation for all the communication that happens today.  Always loved the encodings, decodings of signals, I was and am still marvelled at the engineering of the work horses behind encryption and decryption.  Communication systems designs illustrate how the inventors arrived at the conclusions on the means to transceive messages (now, data) reiliably, securely and efficiently over a distance of choice.

My first stint at work with robotics domain enlightened me more about the ideology behind maintaining and handling data, and deriving multitude of sensitivies from data processing.  Fields like Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, etcetera, empower latest of trends and thereby, bridgen the gap between *human's brain and robot's thinking power*.

At first, I really got interested towards the embedded software and eventually, fell in for the embedded hardware.  Wanting to learn and explore more on the internal workings of the micro-controllers and processors, here I stand, excited to share my learnings on the journey, finished just yet.
